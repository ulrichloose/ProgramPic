A small modification with which the VPP voltage can be implemented with a few components. A Dickson charge pump is used, which is operated with two signals in anti-phase generated by the Arduino. Practically no current is required, only something in the range of 1 mA to operate a Zehner diode. I think 13 volts is too much, since newer components can now be written whose Vpp max is 12 volts. As far as I know, practically all (older) F types run with Vdd + 4 volts up to 13 volts. 12 volts are completely sufficient and the maximum for newer components.

Included is a customized ProgramPic.ino that supplies the charge pump and also switches it on and off. The 9600 baud was increased to 115200.

ArdPicProg has also been changed to 115200 and can be compiled and run on a Mac.

ArdPicProgHost.exe was also changed to 115200.

Since I run the whole thing on MacOs, there are two small bash scripts included - picread and picwrite, which are self-explanatory.

The whole thing became necessary because my ancient Windows laptop with LPT interface gave up the ghost and the Galep programmer can no longer be used.

Maybe someone can (still) use this...
